Just like Regions, Sectors do not need to consider all spatial dimensions; in this case, Sectors are simply a one-dimensional structure.</p><h2>Region</h2><p>Regions make up Sectors and are larger subdivisions of Dyson Ring segments. At this scale, we no longer need to consider three spatial dimensions, and can simplify to a two-dimensional partitioning.</p><h2>Map</h2><p>A Map is the largest volume of space with a collision volume attached to it in memory.</p><h2>MapTile</h2><p>Since holding a whole Map in memory all the time is not quite resource efficient, there is an intermediate step called MapTile that is a smaller subdivision of a Map.</p><h2>Chunk</h2><p>A Chunk is the partition level where geometry data is actually stored. A number of Chunks make up a MapTile. Chunks consists of a regular subdivision into individual Blocks.</p><h2>Block</h2><p>Blocks are individual voxels. They exist in three levels of detail, but conceptually are not independent. Block positions are implicit.</p><h3>Block - coarse LOD</h3><h3>Block - medium LOD</h3><h3>Block - fine LOD</h3><p>The levels of detail are just further regular subdivisions of Blocks to help the engine draw more detail in the immediate (camera) neighborhood.</p><p>!! If the same effect can be convincingly generated by means of parallax mapping to increase the level of apparent surface detail at close range, the LOD approach can be greatly simplified; because of this, the LOD outlined here is to be understood as a placeholder until actual experiments have been carried out. !!</p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 31, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://lucem.github.io/blockyvoxels/what-the-game-might-be.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  What the Game might be "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">What the Game might be</span> </a><a href="https://lucem.github.io/blockyvoxels/data-transformation-rendering.html" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Data transformation - Rendering "><span class="btn__text">Data transformation - Rendering</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Published initially on December 30th, 2023<br>Copyleft - lucem<br>Powered by Publii CMS</p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://lucem.github.io/blockyvoxels/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
