Yeah, kind of. Still, I don't care much. I've seen a lot of those effort, too, and most of them are either bad Minecraft clones, or essentially just tech demos where you fly around and are bored within a minute.</p><p>I want to explore voxel based technology in a different context. So, to say this outright, my goal is not to clone Minecraft. It is however my goal to actually provide a playable game using this technology.</p><p>But first things first. Before there can be any game, there needs to be a solid grasp of the limitations of the technology first.</p><p>So here are my foundations:</p><p>C++ (maybe combined with an embedded scripting language later)<br>Moderate graphics hardware requirements<br>mesh-based rendering (no ray tracing that moderate graphics cards just can't do)<br>Less OOP than you might be comfortable with</p><p>On top of that, here are some other things I already decided upon:</p><p>Everything is made from voxels (yes, models too)<br>Database storage with spatial indexing for "model" data ("model" means everything that is made from voxels)<br>No texture switching (meaning the use of virtual texturing - textures possibly stored in the database as well)<br>Rendered geometry is ultimately generated on the GPU<br>Emphasis on tooling early on</p><p>What I have not decided upon just yet:</p><p>Roll my own rendering code or utilize existing rendering engines<br>other support libraries to go with that</p><p>For now, at this point in time, I am dealing with question of algorithmic and data structure design rather than implementation.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 30, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://lucem.github.io/blockyvoxels/if-anyone-cares-how-this-blog-works.html" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  If anyone cares - how this blog works "><span class="btn__text">If anyone cares - how this blog works</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Published initially on December 30th, 2023<br>Copyleft - lucem<br>Powered by Publii CMS</p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://lucem.github.io/blockyvoxels/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
