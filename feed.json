Yeah, kind of. Still, I don't care much. I've seen a lot of those effort, too, and most of them are either bad Minecraft clones, or essentially just tech demos where you fly around and are bored within a minute.</p>\n<p>I want to explore voxel based technology in a different context. So, to say this outright, my goal is not to clone Minecraft. It is however my goal to actually provide a playable game using this technology.</p>\n<p>But first things first. Before there can be any game, there needs to be a solid grasp of the limitations of the technology first.</p>\n<p>So here are my foundations:</p>\n<p>C++ (maybe combined with an embedded scripting language later)<br>Moderate graphics hardware requirements<br>mesh-based rendering (no ray tracing that moderate graphics cards just can't do)<br>Less OOP than you might be comfortable with</p>\n<p>On top of that, here are some other things I already decided upon:</p>\n<p>Everything is made from voxels (yes, models too)<br>Database storage with spatial indexing for \"model\" data (\"model\" means everything that is made from voxels)<br>No texture switching (meaning the use of virtual texturing - textures possibly stored in the database as well)<br>Rendered geometry is ultimately generated on the GPU<br>Emphasis on tooling early on</p>\n<p>What I have not decided upon just yet:</p>\n<p>Roll my own rendering code or utilize existing rendering engines<br>other support libraries to go with that</p>\n<p>For now, at this point in time, I am dealing with question of algorithmic and data structure design rather than implementation.</p>\n<p>Â </p>",
